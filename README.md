# Text Mining and NLP

This repository contains the materials for the Text Mining and Natural Language Processing discipline, part of the Artificial Intelligence Specialization course.

## Week 1: Introduction to NLP and spaCy

The first week of the course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the `spaCy` library.

### Topics Covered:

*   **Course Overview:** Introduction to NLP, its applications, and the course structure.
*   **Introduction to spaCy:** An overview of the `spaCy` library and its architecture.
*   **Tokenization and POS Tagging:** Understanding how to split text into tokens and assign grammatical tags.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
