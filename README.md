# Text Mining and NLP

This repository contains the materials for the Text Mining and Natural Language Processing discipline, part of the Artificial Intelligence Specialization course.

## Week 1: Introduction to NLP and spaCy

The first week of the course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the `spaCy` library.

### Topics Covered:

*   **Course Overview:** Introduction to NLP, its applications, and the course structure.
*   **Introduction to spaCy:** An overview of the `spaCy` library and its architecture.
*   **Tokenization and POS Tagging:** Understanding how to split text into tokens and assign grammatical tags.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
*   **Lemmatization and Stopwords:** Reducing words to their base form and removing common words.

### Files:

*   `week_1_intro/01 - Course Overview.md`: Course overview and introduction to NLP.
*   `week_1_intro/02 - Introduction to Spacy.md`: Introduction to the `spaCy` library.

## Week 2: Text Representation with Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF

The second week focuses on vector text representation, exploring the Bag-of-Words (BOW) model and the TF-IDF metric.

### Topics Covered:

*   **The Bag-of-Words (BOW) Model:** Understanding the fundamentals of the BOW model.
*   **Practical Implementation with CountVectorizer:** How to implement BOW using Scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer`.
*   **A More Advanced Metric: TF-IDF:** Introduction to Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
*   **Practical Implementation with TfidfVectorizer:** How to implement TF-IDF using Scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer`.
*   **Applications in Information Retrieval and Recommendation:** Use cases for these text representation models.
